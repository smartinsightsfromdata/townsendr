{"name":"Townsend-depr-score-2011","tagline":"Townsend Material Deprivation Score - 2011 Data","body":"Introduction\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThe Townsend Material Deprivation score was originally devised by Townsend et al\r\n(1988). It is based on the following four Census variables:\r\n\r\n1. Percent of households without access to a car.\r\n2. Percent of households with more than one person per room.\r\n3. Percent of households not owner-occupied.\r\n4. Percent of individuals who are economically active unemployed.\r\n\r\nThe four domains above are then combined to produce the overall Townsend Score.\r\nThis score can be calculated for any geographical area that is available in the\r\nCensus tables, for example LSOA, MSOA, Ward, LAD, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause of the way the score is combined, only the relative rank of the scores\r\nis meaningful. In practice, this means it is possible to say an area is more or\r\nless deprived than another, but not what ‘amount’ of deprivation it experiences.\r\nFor this reason it is common to create a score based on a national dataset. This\r\nscript uses data from England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland tables\r\nwere not available at the time of publication (February 2014)). Thus, the scores\r\nreflect the relative deprivation of an area based on similar areas in England\r\nand Wales.\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis R script:\r\n\r\n1. Loads in Census tables and converts them in to usable form (LAD by default)\r\n2. Converts the four domains in to z-scores so they can be combined.\r\n3. Combines the *z*-scores to form one overall index.\r\n4. Rank the scores and produce deciles (quintiles by default).\r\n5. Obtains shapefiles for plotting *z*-scores (LADs by default)\r\n\r\nUsing the Script\r\n================\r\n\r\n[Download the repository as a zip](https://github.com/philmikejones/townsend-depr-score-2011/archive/master.zip) or, if you know what you're doing, make a fork.\r\n\r\nLoad the project in RStudio using `townsend-depr-score-2011.Rproj` which is in the root. If you don't use RStudio set your working directory to the root of the folder with `setwd()`.\r\n\r\nIf you want scores for LADs just run the script `scripts/townsend.R`\r\n\r\nIf you want a geography other than LAD (for example LSOA, MSOA, region) you need\r\nto modify the Nomis web API calls on lines:\r\n\r\n1. 39 (car)\r\n2. 47 (overcrowding)\r\n3. 55 (tenure)\r\n4. 64 (economically active unemployed)\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the API is available from: `https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/help`\r\n\r\nYou also need to obtain the link to the relevant shapefiles from `http://census.edina.ac.uk/easy_download.html`. In general, right-click on the geography you require and copy the link to paste in to the script.\r\n\r\nOnce complete the script should produce one file - `data/townsendScore.csv` - which contains geography code, overall Townsend Score (*z*-score), and quintile of deprivation for each geography in England and Wales which can be used in further analyses. It will also save a map to `maps/ewTownDep.pdf` for quick inspection.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThe code is GPL v3 license.
